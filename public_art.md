## Harry Weber Sculptures

Over the course of four years, sculptor Harry Weber was commissioned to create likenesses of Bob Gibson, Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter, Lou Brock, Red Schoendienst, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Cool Papa Bell, George Sisler, and Ozzie Smith.

 ### Artist overview
Harry Weber
b. 1942

A renowned, international sculptor, Harry Weber was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1942. He studied art history at Princeton University. Weber has produced a body of work of over 90 large and more than 200 smaller pieces. His work embodies human emotion and power with a spontaneity developed from a lifelong habit of sketching from observation. He creates sculptures with a distinct style that makes maximum use of the natural fluidity of the bronze medium, capturing a single moment that never appears static or posed. In 2011 he was named Sports Artist of the Year by the US Sports Academy.
