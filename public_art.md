### Artist overview
 
Harry Weber
b. 1942

A renowned, international sculptor, Harry Weber was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1942. He studied art history at Princeton University. Weber has produced a body of work of over 90 large and more than 200 smaller pieces. His work embodies human emotion and power with a spontaneity developed from a lifelong habit of sketching from observation. He creates sculptures with a distinct style that makes maximum use of the natural fluidity of the bronze medium, capturing a single moment that never appears static or posed. In 2011 he was named Sports Artist of the Year by the US Sports Academy.
