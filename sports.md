> The Dome at America's Center is a multi-purpose stadium used for concerts, major conventions and sporting events in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Previously known as the Trans World Dome from 1995 to 2001 and the Edward Jones Dome from 2002 to 2016, it was constructed largely to lure a National Football League (NFL) team back to St. Louis and to serve as a convention space.
 
> The Dome at America’s Center has hosted numerous major conventions, trade shows and exhibitions as well as events as varied as rock concerts, motocross races and monster truck rallies. In 1999, The Dome at America’s Center hosted a Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II, which was the largest indoor gathering ever held in the U.S. The facility has also played host to a number of large-scale amateur and professional sporting events, including the 2005 NCAA® Men’s Final Four®.

The St. Louis BattleHawks of the revived XFL began play at the stadium in early 2020.
