If anyone remember's this early 2000's business simulation video computer game, you'll recall that this world focus around building and running successful zoo scenarios. Here we will quickly do a simplified version with a focus on project managment. 

 - Form groups of ~4 people
 - Set up a project board on the table or wall. Prepare 4 columns with blue masking tape for each stage of production: 
    - :clipboard: **Ideas**: Generate good, bad, and maybe ideas!
       - Pick an exhibit to build (e.g., reptiles, mystical sea monsters, dinosaurs, insects, safari) and collaboratively decide what your exhibit needs and write down each "task" (aka drawing assignment) on a post-it (e.g., animals, toys for animals, benches, bathing pools). 
    - **Ready to work on**: The idea now has a clear path forward and someone can pick up the task. 
      - Organize tasks to get the ready for deligation. 
    - **In progress**: Assign tasks and get to work! Let your team mates know you're on it.  
    - **Done**: You did it! Let your team mates know you got the job done.  
 - (5 min each:) Report out! What was in your zoo/exhibit and how efficient was the team at getting the task done?

Why do we need branches? Bad things happening if you are not careful about how and when you commit changes!

 - What is a branch
 - How to create a branch
 - How to make sure you are on your branch

 - **Find your branch** You can click on the hyperlink in the issue or find your branch on the [branches page of the repo](https://github.com/RWorkflow-Workshops/WSDS-StLouis/branches). Each branch will be named with the number of your issue and the name of the issue. 
 - Move all tasks on the project board to done. 
 - Work on your tasks in your branch. Move all tasks on the project board to from idea, ready, in progress, and done! 
 
### *10:30-10:45* Lecture and Demo: Using pull requests
